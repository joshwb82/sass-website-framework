## Running the tests

To check that it has all been setup correctly. 

Type **npm install** which will install all your NPM moduales

Once you have installed all the dependencies type **gulp** into the terminal.

This will run all the required dependencies.

Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, you will now be able to see any changes you make to the files inside src folder.

The gulp command will also create the **tmp** file which will create the development version of the contents of **src** folder.

NOTE
**ctrl c** will stop the watch and server

If you are uploading the new site to a new repo and you want to remove the **tmp** and **dist** folders from the project you just need to type **gulp clean**  


## Deployment

To deploy the site run **gulp build** in terminal and it will create a **dist** folder inside the root folder where it will save all the production ready code. all the files will be minified.
